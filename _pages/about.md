Hi! I am a Master's student in Computer Science at UC Riverside, currently working with [Prof. Yinglun Zhu](https://yinglunz.com/) on data distillation using diffusion models. I am also interested in studying mathematical reasoning problems through NeuroSymbolic AI. Feel free to reach out if you're working in this area and are open to potential collaboration!


In prior, I interned at IIT Patna and IIT Kharagpur. I worked with [Abhisek Tiwari](https://abhisektiwari.github.io/) at IIT Patna under the guidance of [Prof. Sriparna Saha](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/) on knowledge-infused dialogue systems and multimodal summarization. At IIT Kharagpur, I worked with [Nilanjan Sinhababu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilanjansb/?originalSubdomain=in) under the supervision of [Prof. Pabitra Mitra](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pabitra/) to study neural question generation within the field of expert healthcare informatics.
