Hi! I am Shreyangshu an incoming grad student at UC Riverside. Now, learning Neurosymbolic AI and trying to integrate it into large language models (LLMs). One area where LLMs often fall short is in their ability to reason effectively, particularly in tasks requiring logical inference and understanding of complex contexts. The objective is to find ways, how we can leverage neurosymbolic techniques to augment the reasoning abilities of LLMs. We're not just looking to improve performance; we're aiming to change the way these models understand and interpret language.


In prior, I interned at IIT Patna and IIT Kharagpur. I worked with [Abhisek Tiwari](https://abhisektiwari.github.io/) at IIT Patna under the guidance of [Prof. Sriparna Saha](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/) on knowledge-infused dialogue systems and multimodal summarization. At IIT Kharagpur, I worked with [Nilanjan Sinhababu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilanjansb/?originalSubdomain=in) under the supervision of [Prof. Pabitra Mitra](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pabitra/) to study neural question generation within the field of expert healthcare informatics.
