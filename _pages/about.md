Hi! I am a Master's student in Computer Science at UC Riverside (Advised by [Prof, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury](https://vcg.ece.ucr.edu/amit)).


In prior, I interned at IIT Patna and IIT Kharagpur. I worked with [Abhisek Tiwari](https://abhisektiwari.github.io/) at IIT Patna under the guidance of [Prof. Sriparna Saha](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/) on knowledge-infused dialogue systems and multimodal summarization. At IIT Kharagpur, I worked with [Nilanjan Sinhababu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilanjansb/?originalSubdomain=in) under the supervision of [Prof. Pabitra Mitra](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pabitra/) to study neural question generation within the field of expert healthcare informatics.
