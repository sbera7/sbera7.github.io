Hi! I am a Master's student in Computer Science at UC Riverside (advised by [Prof, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury](https://vcg.ece.ucr.edu/amit)).


In prior, I interned at IIT Patna and IIT Kharagpur. At IIT Patna, I worked on knowledge-infused dialogue systems and multimodal summarization (advised by [Prof. Sriparna Saha](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/)). At IIT Kharagpur, I worked on neural question generation within the field of expert healthcare informatics and studied Explainability in AI (advised by [Prof. Pabitra Mitra](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pabitra/)).
