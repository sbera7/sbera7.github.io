<span style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">Learning Neurosymbolic AI and trying to integrate it into large language models. Present-day's systems are often opaque, brittle, and difficult to control, which limits their usefulness in human-centered applications. To make them our trustworthy collaborators, my research aims to (i) understand the computational foundation of generalization in novel scenarios, and (ii) build interactive systems that align with user's goals.

A final year student of Computer Science at Chandigarh University. In prior, I interned at IIT Patna and IIT Kharagpur. I worked with [Abhisek Tiwari](https://abhisektiwari.github.io/) at IIT Patna under the guidance of [Prof. Sriparna Saha](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/) on projects involving knowledge-infused dialogue systems and multimodal summarization. At IIT Kharagpur, I worked with [Nilanjan Sinhababu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilanjansb/?originalSubdomain=in) under the supervision of [Prof. Pabitra Mitra](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pabitra/) to study neural question generation within the field of expert healthcare informatics.
